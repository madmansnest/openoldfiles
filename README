Open Old Files
==============

What is it?
-----------

An extremely simple (15 lines of vimscript) plugin that shows a buffer with the contents of `:oldfiles` and allows the user to press `<CR>` to open the file under cursor or `<Esc>` to close the buffer.

Vim/Neovim help files, terminal and fugitive windows are hopefully filtered out.

How to install it?
------------------

Honestly, just copy the contents of `plugin/openoldfiles.vim` file into your `init.nvim` or `vimrc`.

But you can also do `Plug 'madmansnest/openoldfiles'` or whatever you want.

Add the following line to your `init.nvim` or `vimrc`:

`nnoremap <Leader>oof <cmd>call openoldfiles#List()<CR>`

Of course, you can use another mapping of your liking.

How to use it?
--------------

Press `<Leader>oof` or whatever your mapping is.

A buffer will open.

You can navigate it as a regular vim buffer, using search, or whatever.

To choose the file, move the cursor to it and press `<CR>`.

To discard the buffer, press `<Esc>`.
